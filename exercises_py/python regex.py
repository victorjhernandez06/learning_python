""""Python RegEx"""
# a regex, orr regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
# RegEx can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.

"""RegEx Module"""
# Python has built-in package called re, which can be used to work with Regular Expressions.

# Import the re module
import re

"""RegEx in Python"""
# when you have imported the re module, you can start using regular expressions.
# Example: Search the string to see if it starts with "Thee" and ends with "Spain":

txt = "the rain in Spain"
x = re.search("^The.*Spain$", txt)

"""RegEx Functions"""
# The re module offers a set of functions that allows us to seacrh a string for a match.

#Function  ---> Description
#findall --> Returns a list containing all matches

#Search --> Returns a Match Object if there is a match anywhere in the string.

#Split --> Returns  list where the string has been split at each match.

#Sub --> Replaces one or many matches with a string.

"""Metacharacters"""
# Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning

# [] --> A set characters --> "[a-m]"
# \ signals a special sequence (can also be used to escape to special characters) --> "\d"
# . --> Any characters (except newline character) --> "he..o"
# ^ --> Ends with --> "^hello"

txt = "the rain in Spain"

# find all lower case characters alphabetically between "a" and "m"
x = re.findall('[a-m]', txt)
print(x) #--> ['h', 'e', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'a', 'i']

txt2 = "That will be 59 dollars"
#Find all digit characters:
x1 = re.findall("\d", txt2)
print(x1) #--> ['5', '9']

txt3 = "hello planet"
#Search for a sequence that starts with "he" followed bt two (any) characters, and "0"
x2 = re.findall("he..o",txt3)
print(x2) #--> ['hello']

txt4 = "hello planet"
#Check if the string starts with 'hello':
x3  = re.findall("^hello", txt4)
if x3:
    print("Yes, the string starts with 'hello'")
else:
    print("No match")
# --> Yes, the string starts with 'hello' <-- #

txt5 = "hello planet"
#check if the string ends with 'planet'
x4 = re.findall("planet$",txt5)
if x3:
    print("Yes, the string starts with 'planet'")
else:
    print("No match")
# --> Yes, the string starts with 'planet' <-- #

txt6 = "hello planet"
#Search for a sequence that starts with "he", followed by 0 or more (any) characters, and an "o"
x5  = re.findall("he.*o",txt6)
print(x5)
# --> ['hello'] <-- #

txt7 = "hello planet"
#Search for a sequence that starts with "he" followed by 1 or more (any) characters, and an "o"
x6 = re.findall("he.+o",txt7)
print(x6)
# --> ['hello'] <-- #

txt8 = "hello planet"
#Searcch for a sequence that starts with "he" followed by 0 by 1 (any) character, and an "o"
x7 = re.findall("he.?o",txt8)
print(x7)
# --> [] <-- #

text9 = "hello planet"
#Search for a sequence that starts with "he" followed exactly 2(any) characters, and an "o"
x8 = re.findall("he.{2}o",text9)
print(x8)
# --> ['hello'] <-- #

txt10 = "The rain in Spain falls mainly in the plain!"
# Check if the string contains either "falls" or "stays":
x9 = re.findall("falls|stays", txt10)
print(x9)
if x9:
    print("Yes, there is at least one match!")
else:
    print("No match")

# --> ['falls'] <-- #
# --> Yes, there is at least one match! <-- #

"""Flags"""
# You can add flags to the pattern when using regular expressions.
